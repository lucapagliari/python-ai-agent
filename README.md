# Learning AI Agents with Python

## Overview
A personal project to explore and learn about AI agents using Python. This repository contains experimental code and is intended for learning purposes only. The main focus is on testing how agents interact with functions stored in the `/functions` directory to understand, modify, and run the `/calculator` application.

## Purpose
- Understand AI agent behavior and interactions
- Test different agent configurations
- Learn through hands-on implementation
- Document findings and learnings
- Experiment with agent function calling capabilities
- Study how agents can interpret and use functions from the `/functions` directory
- Analyze agent behavior in modifying and running the `/calculator` application

## Structure
- Simple agent implementations using Gemini free tier
- `/functions` directory containing callable functions
- `/calculator` sample application for testing agent understanding and bugfixing capabilities
